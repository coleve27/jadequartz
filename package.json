The growth of the Austin Asian Pacific Islander (API) population has led to increasing numbers of API-owned stores, restaurants, boutiques, religious organizations, community groups, non-profits, and news outlets. Jade Quartz will take in data about all these organizations into an easy-to-access database for AARC staff to use.",
